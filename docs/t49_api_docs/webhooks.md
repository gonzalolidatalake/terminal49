# Webhooks

## Creating Webhooks

You may subscribe to events through webhooks to be alerted when events are triggered.

Visit [https://app.terminal49.com/developers/webhooks](https://app.terminal49.com/developers/webhooks) and click the 'Create Webhook Endpoint' button to create your webhook through the UI.

If you prefer to create webhooks programatically then see the [webhooks post endpoint documentation](/api-docs/api-reference/webhooks/create-a-webhook).

## Available Webook Events

Each `WebhookNotification` event represents some change to a model which you may be notified of.

List of Supported Events:

## Receiving Webhooks

When an event is triggered we will attempt to post to the URL you provided with the webhook.

The payload of every webhook is a `webhook_notification`. Each Webhook notification includes a `reference_object` in it's relationships which is the subject of that notification (e.g. a tracking request, or an updated container).

Please note that we expect the endpoint to return [HTTP 200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200), [HTTP 201](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201), [HTTP 202](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202) or [HTTP 204](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204). We aim to deliver all webhook notifications, so any other response, including timeout, will result in a dozen of retries.

> [How to Troubleshoot Missing Webhook Notifications](https://help.terminal49.com/en/articles/7851422-missing-webhook-notifications)

## Security

There are a few ways you can verify the webhooks sent by Terminal49.

Verify webhook signatures to confirm that received events are sent from Terminal49. Additionally, Terminal49 sends webhook events from a set list of IP addresses. Only trust events coming from these IP addresses.

### Webhook notification origin IP

The full list of IP addresses that webhook notifications may come from is:

```
35.222.62.171
3.230.67.145
44.217.15.129
```

### Verifying the webhook signature (optional)

When you create or get a webhook the model will include an attribute `secret`.

Whenever a webhook notification is delivered we create a signature by using the webhook `secret` as the key to generate a HMAC hex digest with SHA-256 on the body.

This signature is added as the header `X-T49-Webhook-Signature`

If you would like to verify that the webhook payload has not been tampered with by a 3rd party, then you can perform the same operation on the response body with the webhook secret and confirm that the digests match.

Below is a basic example of how this might look in a rails application.

```ruby  theme={null}
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  def receive_tracking_request
    secret = ENV.fetch('TRACKING_REQUEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
    raise 'InvalidSignature' unless valid_signature?(request, secret)

    # continue processing webhook payload...

  end

  private

  def valid_signature?(request, secret)
    hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest('SHA256', secret, request.body.read)
    request.headers['X-T49-Webhook-Signature'] == hmac
  end
end
```

## Webhook Notification Examples

### container.updated

The container updated event lets you know about changes to container properties at the terminal, or which terminal the container is (or will be) located at.

The `changeset` attribute on is a hash of all the properties which changed on the container.

Each changed property is the hash key. The prior value is the first item in the array, and the current value is the second item in the array.

For example:

```
"changeset": {
  "pickup_lfd": [null, "2020-05-20 00:00:00"]
}
```

Shows that the pickup last free day has changed from not being set to May 20 2020.

The properties we show changes for are:

* fees\_at\_pod\_terminal
* holds\_at\_pod\_terminal
* pickup\_lfd
* pickup\_appointment\_at
* available\_for\_pickup
* pod\_terminal

In every case the attribute `container_updated.timestamp` tells you when we picked up the changes from the terminal.

As container availability becomes known or changes at the POD Terminal we will send `container_updated` events with the key `available_for_pickup` in the `changeset`.

The `pod_terminal` is a relationship of the container. When the pod\_terminal changes the id is included. The terminal will be serialized in the included models.

N.B. the `container_updated_event` also has a relationship to a `terminal` which refers to where the information came from. Currently this is always the POD terminal. In the future this may be the final destination terminal or an off-dock location.
